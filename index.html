			      <blockquote> 
		                  <p>																								"One Enchanted day, an ordinary robin made a nest in Felix Dragonhammer’s shoe. This was not a dirty, slimy smelly shoe, but a dwarf shoe and 					that means comfort. But when he was in his nest, he found out that he could breathe fire. Felix went to put on his shoe and found a fountain 					of fire where his shoe was. As Felix looked out beyond the green meadow, he saw a roaring dragon high up in the sky. The former robin roared 					again before descending on the poor helpless Felix, when suddenly he was clad in shining armor and held a deadly sword. Robin reduced him to 					cinders and flew away to terrorize other towns. A second robin happened upon Felix’s remains and felt pity in his heart. Robin II got his 					sidekick, Batman, and together they gave the cinders CPR. But alas, it was to no avail. Robin II contracted a very deadly and contagious 					virus that destroys a person’s soul and infected General Sarbina, who perished after a long and agonizing hour.  Then, the corpse began 					to breakdance. He was singing “Staying Alive” to the robin."
